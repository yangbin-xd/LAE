## Introduction:  
data is the dataset generated by MATLAB                
model is to save the deep learning model  
result is to save the generated pictures and NMSE results  
loss is to save training and validation loss
preprocess.py is to transfer the mat file to npy file  
process.py is to process CSI and label
cgan.py is the benchmark of CGAN
dnn.py & lstm.py is the benchmark of DNN + LSTM  
cnn.py contains LS, ChannelNet and radio map  
fig1.py is the code to plot Fig. x in the paper  
fig2.py is the code to plot Fig. 12 in the paper  
fig3.py is the code to plot Fig. 13 in the paper  
fig4.py is the code to plot Fig. x in the paper  
fig5.py is the code to plot Fig. 14 in the paper  
fig6.py is the code to plot Fig. 15 in the paper
